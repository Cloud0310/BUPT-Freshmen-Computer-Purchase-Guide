# BUPT-Freshmen-Computer-Purchase-Guide
 A Guide to freshmen of BUPT to Purchase Computers
## Welcome anyone from BUPT to commmit and fork as you like. ##
The aim of this project is to helping freshmen to get a computer to code and develop projects for the open source community at a fair price.
Every year, we (BUPT digital club) will audit commits and export this repo's main.md file to PDF for freshmen, aiming at helping them to get a tool suitable for learning.
